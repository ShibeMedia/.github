# Shibe Media
Shibe Media was established with the objective of promoting honesty and transparency in media through the creation of tools that facilitate open collaboration, improve source traceability, and provide a framework for comprehensive free-knowledge databases. As a pilot for this initiative, we chose to focus our efforts in-line with the Doge community, which is often neglected by the mainstream media. To achieve our goal and support the development of these open-source tools, we founded Shibe Magazine, a media publication that utilizes the tools developed by Shibe Media developers. Our aim is not only to provide top-quality news coverage for Shibes, but also to empower others with tools to join us in our mission of improving the current media environment, regardless of the topic.
